# Genesis Sample Sass

This is Genesis Sample 2.6.0's style.css split into Sass partials, based on the work by Christoph Herr in his [Prometheus](https://github.com/christophherr/prometheus) Genesis child theme.

Thanks, also to Brian Johnson for converting the Sass partials to be compatible with Convertkit 3.

## Note

Two additional files, `_home.scss` and `_custom.scss` have been added for your custom homepage and site-wide CSS.
