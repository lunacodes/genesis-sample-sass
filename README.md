# Genesis Sample Sass

This is Genesis Sample 2.10.0's style.css split into Sass partials, based on the work of Sridkar Katakam's [genesis-sample-sass](https://github.com/srikat/genesis-sample-sass) project, which was based on the project work by Christoph Herr in his [Prometheus](https://github.com/christophherr/prometheus) Genesis child theme.

Thanks, also to Brian Johnson for converting the Sass partials to be compatible with Convertkit 3.

## Note

Two additional files, `_home.scss` and `_custom.scss` have been added for your custom homepage and site-wide CSS.

## Known Issues

* partials/_variables.scss
	* See if there are other variables worth adding
	* Improve visual grouping of variables, for readability benefits
